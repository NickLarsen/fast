TODO: stream
----------------
abstract away the KdTree so we only need it in one place instead of webapi and helpers
extract graph model from OSM so we don't have to do it every time
improve perf on locating nearest point, set a threshold on nearest point as well
remove IProblem.GetGoalState, the algorithm doesnt need it, it's a helper for building problems only
refactor the NPuzzleProblem and NPuzzle because all the logic is in NPuzzle currently
implement the tests in the TODOs for NPuzzle
animation showing how to solve it


remeber:
    dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName=fast.search.tests.SolverTests.TestFindingDirectionsBreadthFirstSearch"


DONE:
----------------
2019-02-20
write a script to get the data needed for the lima map
get rid of the hardcoded path for datasets from everywhere that uses it (currently in OsmTests.cs)
