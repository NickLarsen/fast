----------------
make the OSM graph extraction work for 1 way streets
get rid of the hardcoded path for datasets from everywhere that uses it (currently in OsmTests.cs)
find a way to grab the nodes out of the map so we can start blank
remove IProblem.GetGoalState, the algorithm doesnt need it, it's a helper for building problems only
refactor the NPuzzleProblem and NPuzzle because all the logic is in NPuzzle currently
implement the tests in the TODOs for NPuzzle
animation showing how to solve it


remeber:
    dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName=fast.search.tests.SolverTests.TestFindingDirectionsBreadthFirstSearch"
