TODO: stream
----------------
refactor the NPuzzleProblem and NPuzzle because all the logic is in NPuzzle currently
implement the tests in the TODOs for NPuzzle
animation showing how to solve it


remeber:
    dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName=fast.search.tests.SolverTests.TestIDAStarSearchManhattanDistance"


DONE:
----------------

change the goal state to match the literature
OpenSet returns true/false for was improvement
make the solver generic so it can solve any problem
offstream: 
    implement IDA*/improve the nodes explored per sec by orders of magnitude
    ^ improve the nodes explored per sec by orders of magnitude
